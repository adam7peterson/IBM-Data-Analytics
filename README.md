Capstone Project: Emerging IT Skills Analysis Project Overview

This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. The project aims to analyze and identify the most in-demand programming skills, leveraging data from various sources to provide actionable insights for this year's report on emerging IT skills.

Project Steps Data Collection:

Extracted data from job postings, training portals, and surveys.
Aggregated data in formats such as .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.
Data Wrangling:

Cleaned and prepared data using advanced data wrangling techniques with Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Ensured data quality and consistency.
Trend Analysis:

Analyzed the data to identify key insights and trends.
Focused on:

Top programming languages in demand
Essential database skills
Popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Statistical Techniques:

Applied statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights.
Used various Python libraries like (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, BeautifulSoup, ect) for statistical analysis.
Data Visualization:
